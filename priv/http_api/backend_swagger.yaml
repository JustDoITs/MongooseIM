  title: MongooseIM control backend REST API
  description: This REST API provides similar control functionaly to the `mongooseimctl` command. The response objects are modeled on the `ejabberd_commands` entries and print-outs from `mongooseimctl` though the final API will need to be consistent with the MongooseIM's **command registry**.
